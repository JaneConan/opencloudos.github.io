# Introduction

OpenCloudOS, an open source operating system community jointly initiated by Tencent and its partners, is a completely neutral, open, secure, stable and high-performance operating system and ecosystem. OpenCloudOS has accumulated the advantages of many vendors in the software and open source ecosystem, inherited Tencent's more than 10 years of technology accumulation in the operating system and kernel, and has solid support in cloud native, stability, performance, hardware support and other aspects, which can support all hardware platforms equally and comprehensively.

OpenCloudOS 9 is a full-link server operating system community version jointly developed by OpenCloudOS community partners. The kernel and user mode software of the upstream OpenCloudOS Stream version are based on the independent selection, evolution and maintenance of Upstream community. No longer dependent on other distributions. OpenCloudOS 9 provides users and services with a more advanced and higher-performance basic environment and service capabilities by comprehensively optimizing and polishing the kernel and user-mode software, and solves the problem of interrupted CentOS supply.
